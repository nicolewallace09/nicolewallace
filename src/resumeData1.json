    "bio":"Hello, I'm Nicole! I switched my gears from my education in Business to take on Web Development to keep challenging myself in ways I thought I never could. Web Development allows me to continually create and creatively find new ways to make processes better. I always believed that anything can be improved and there are different ways to solve problems. With that being said, I am Full Stack Web Developer based in the San Francisco Bay Area with a Bachelorâ€™s Degree and 2+ years professional experience in Business Administration combined with 3 different Liberal Arts degrees. I am a naturally curious person which makes me want to always learn new things. I am a problem-solver who questions everything. I am a hard worker who doesn't take life too seriously and enjoys the little things. You will always find a smile on my face.",
